title: filter-Evaluation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The subfilter is always evaluated for each input title in turn with a given variable set to the currently processed title, e.g. ''inputTitle''. There are three ways to define the ''source'' of tiddlers against which the subfilter is evaluated: 

; 1. each input title
: by default, the subfilter in the operand is evaluated against ''each'' input title in turn
: `a b c +[filter<foo>]`
:: //evaluates ''foo'' three times, each time given the respective input title as its source to iterate on//
; 2. all input titles
: using the ''input'' suffix, the subfilter is evaluated against ''all'' input titles for ''each'' input title in turn
: `a b c +[filter:input<foo>]`
:: //evaluates ''foo'' three times as well, each time given all three input title as the source to iterate on//
; 3. any titles
: the subfilter can be evaluated for each input title in turn against any arbitrary titles by using a "set-creating" filter such as the <<x "all Operator" "all operator">>
:: another filter operator creating sets is [[make]]
: `a b c +[filter<foo>]`
:: //also evaluates ''foo'' three times; however, using `[all[tiddlers]]` within ''foo'' the subfilter is evaluated at each turn against any titles imaginable//
:: the difference to ''1.'' is merely in how the subfilter is defined
